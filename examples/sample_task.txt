Build a Python-based REST API for a book inventory management system that allows users to:

1. Add new books with details (title, author, ISBN, publication date, genre, etc.)
2. Search for books by various criteria
3. Update book information
4. Delete books
5. Track book borrowing status

The system should:
- Use FastAPI for the API framework
- Store data in a SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Have unit tests
- Include API documentation using Swagger UI
- Support pagination for search results

The application should follow modern Python coding standards and be designed for maintainability and future extension.
