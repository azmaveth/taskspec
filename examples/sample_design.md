# Weather Alert System Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a Weather Alert System that monitors weather conditions, analyzes potential hazards, and delivers timely alerts to users based on their location and preferences. The system will provide personalized weather alerts to help users prepare for and respond to weather events.

## User Requirements

1. Users should be able to register and specify their location(s) of interest
2. Users should be able to set preferences for alert types and thresholds
3. Users should receive timely alerts for severe weather events
4. Users should be able to view historical alerts and weather data
5. Users should have multiple notification options (email, SMS, push notifications)

## System Architecture

The system will follow a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Data Collection Service
- Integrates with external weather data APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, NOAA)
- Periodically fetches and stores weather data
- Performs initial data normalization and validation

### Alert Analysis Engine
- Analyzes weather data against predefined alert criteria
- Identifies potential weather hazards based on configurable thresholds
- Generates alert metadata (severity, impact area, duration, etc.)

### User Preference Service
- Manages user profiles and alert preferences
- Stores user locations and notification settings
- Handles authentication and authorization

### Alert Delivery System
- Matches alerts with user preferences
- Manages delivery channels (email, SMS, push notifications)
- Handles notification throttling and batching
- Tracks delivery status and user interactions

### Web and Mobile Interfaces
- Provides user registration and profile management
- Displays current and forecasted weather information
- Shows active and historical alerts
- Allows users to manage notification preferences

## Data Model

## Technical Requirements

### Backend
- Python/Django for REST API development
- PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- Redis for caching and pub/sub messaging
- Celery for background task processing

### Frontend
- React for web interface
- React Native for mobile applications
- Redux for state management
- Material-UI for component library

### Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- AWS or GCP for cloud hosting
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Non-functional Requirements
- System should handle at least 100,000 users
- Alert delivery should occur within 2 minutes of detection
- System should maintain 99.9% uptime
- API response time should be less than 200ms for 95% of requests
- Data should be retained for at least 1 year
